#Smart Surveillance System

This directory contains two files that bring together all the various topics we have discussed such as AWS S3, OpenCV, Twilio, etc to create a simple "Smart Surveillance" system.

`motion_surveillance.py` utilizes the motion detection algorithms to trigger the alert while `facial_surveillance.py` utilizes the face detection algorithms to trigger the alert.
