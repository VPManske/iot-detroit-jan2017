#Face Detection
This repository contains information and example code on how to perform face detection using Haar Feature-based Cascade Classifiers.

##Pre-trained classifiers
OpenCV already comes with many pre-trained classifiers for faces, eyes, smiles, objects, etc. In our examples we will use the pre-trained classifiers for the face and eyes.
- **haarcascade_frontalface_default.xml** - Cascade classifier file for faces from the front viewing angle
- **haarcascade_eye.xml** - Cascade classifier file for eyes from the front viewing angle
