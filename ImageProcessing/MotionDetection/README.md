# Motion Detection
Repository for Motion Detector Code

##motion_detector_static_ref.py
The source for this code is a tutorial from Adrian Rosebrock @ pyimagesearch about installing a simple motion detection algorithm using OpenCV on a Raspberry Pi. The tutorial is located at the URL, http://www.pyimagesearch.com/2015/05/25/basic-motion-detection-and-tracking-with-python-and-opencv/.

The overly simplified basis for the motion detection in this code is background subtraction using a reference frame. The code calculates the pixel differences between the current frame and the reference frame and then compares it to a threshold to determine if there is motion.

This code makes the assumption that the first frame of our video file will contain no motion and just background â€” therefore, we can model the background of our video stream using only the first frame of the video. As we can probably guess with a live webcam, this is probably not going to be true if we run the code sitting in front of the webcam as I did many times. Changes in lighting and shadows will also cause issues to this but this is a simple algorithm to show what could potentially be accomplished.

##motion_detector_static_ref_button.py
This code is an extension of ```motion_detector_static_ref.py``` that adds the GPIO functionality to update the reference frame based on a button press.

**Lines 57-60** check to see if the reference frame has been initialized as shown in the code snippet below.

```python
	# if the first frame is None, initialize it
	if firstFrame is None:
		firstFrame = gray
		continue
```

So we can update this reference frame by setting firstFrame to None which is what we do in the callback function shown below.

```python
# Button Callback function to create new reference frame, firstFrame
def btn_cb():
	# In order to reference the global variable, need to declare callback variable as global
	global firstFrame
	firstFrame = None
	print("Button Pressed!")
```

And finally we register the callback function, ```btn_cb``` with the GPIO as shown below

```python
btnA = Button("GPIO-A")
btnA.when_pressed(btn_cb)
```
