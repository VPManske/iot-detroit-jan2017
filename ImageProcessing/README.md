#Image Processing using OpenCV

The following examples illustrate some image processing techniquest using Python OpenCV.

The default linaro debian image that we are using for these examples did not come with Python OpenCV so we need to install it as shown below.

```
sudo apt-get install python-opencv
```
As of the time of this exercise, the above command installed Python OpenCV 2.4.9.1.
